# xStrata v9.2.17 — Plain-English Overview (One Page)

## What it is
xStrata is a smart contract that lets anyone create a “sealed” digital item (an NFT) on Stacks, where the underlying content is uploaded in pieces and permanently locked in once completed.

Think of it like:
- Uploading a large file in reliable chunks, and
- Only “publishing” it once the contract has verified it is complete and unaltered.

## What it’s for
It’s built for creators who want:
- A clear, verifiable “this existed at this point in time” record
- A way to store large content as multiple small pieces
- A permanent final version (no silent edits after publishing)
- Compatibility with common NFT wallets and indexers

## How it works (in human terms)
1) A creator starts an upload session for a piece of content.
2) They upload the content in batches (like sending 50 parcels at a time).
3) The contract continually checks integrity as the pieces arrive.
4) When the upload is complete, the creator “seals” it:
   - the contract checks everything is there
   - the contract checks the final fingerprint (hash) matches
   - an NFT is minted
   - the content becomes permanent and unchangeable

## Ownership and provenance
- The person who seals (mints) the inscription is recorded as the **creator** forever.
- The NFT can be transferred to other people like a normal NFT.
- Ownership can change, but creator attribution does not.

## Fees and sustainability of the system
The contract can charge small STX fees for:
- starting an upload session (paid once)
- sealing (minting) the inscription (scaled by how many upload batches are needed)

These fees can be directed to a chosen recipient (e.g., a treasury, a DAO, a creative fund, or a maintainer).

## Safety controls
There is a “pause” switch that can temporarily stop new uploads and sealing if needed (for safety or maintenance).
Importantly:
- pausing does **not** block transfers
- pausing does **not** block viewing or reading existing inscriptions

## Optional: “recursive” works (dependencies)
A creator can optionally say:
“This inscription depends on earlier inscriptions.”
This creates a simple on-chain link to up to 50 earlier items, useful for:
- collections that reference earlier parts
- derivative works
- “this includes / builds on these ingredients” style composition

## What it does *not* do
- It does not allow editing the content after sealing.
- It does not allow the admin to rewrite people’s inscriptions.
- It does not prevent owners from transferring their NFTs.

## Why SIP-009 matters
SIP-009 is the standard NFT interface on Stacks.
Supporting it improves compatibility with wallets, marketplaces, and indexers.
