1) Check on how fully formed our approach is to recursive inscriptions. Not only are we trying to make it as convenient and cheap as possible to create recursive apps but also need to understand how to reference cross contract files in a recursive app and what changes (if any) need to be made to the platform or protocol to improve, enhance and streamline recursive funtionality and performance to make xStrata the best and most functional on-chain data layer secured directly to Bitcoin at around 1/100-1/1000 of the cost of ordinal inscriptions. How ready are we? What improvementss could still be made?

2) Investigate how we can use the current or evolved version of the code as a basslayer that can support a consumer facing frontend with much less admin level controls and a UI that is more suited to an inscription platform where people inscribe NFTs as well as code and modular frameworks for complex on-chain applications like DAWs where the blockchain keeps track of every note you play, every fader you adjust, every mix you make - laying the foundations for a transparent, fair music landscape of the future where attribution, distribution and fair royalty payments all take place in a fully transparent deeply efficient framework where there is little to no need for the majority non-creative population to administrate any of it.

3) Please investigate batch minting so users are able to, for example, pick a folder of images that can all be inscribed in a single process with multiple batches if needs be and then all of the collection are then inscribed as sequential inscriptions. It would also be great to have a recursive module minting process where users can drop modules with a manifest or something so the platform inscribes all modules then seals the correct dependencies at the end so multiple modules and inscriptions but a single inscription process like the batch minting idea above.

4) Please discuss how parent child relationships can be implemented with both contracts - can we implement a module that allows people to select parent inscriptions from their my wallet collections to be used as a parent to an inscription about to take place in the mint section? Ideally if selected in my wallet as a parent the parent is displayed in the right column along with other metadata in the mint panel so it is visually clear that an inscription is going to be made as a child of another inscription.
