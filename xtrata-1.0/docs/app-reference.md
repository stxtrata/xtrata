# App Reference Map

Purpose: one-stop map of where code lives and which files to touch for common updates.

## Strategic focus (Protocol Team mode)

- Keep the first-party app and marketplace live and reliable, but treat them as reference implementations.
- Prioritize protocol-layer stability, SDK tooling, and third-party builder experience.
- Default new reusable logic to SDK-oriented modules (or SDK-ready helpers) before app-specific UI logic.
- Add "Built using Xtrata Protocol" positioning in product copy where appropriate, while preserving existing UX.
- Preserve backwards compatibility for core mint/view flows while extracting reusable primitives.

## SDK-first decision filter (read before implementation)

1) Is this feature useful to external builders (marketplaces, games, launchpads, creator tools)?
2) If yes, define the reusable interface first (types, function contracts, errors), then wire first-party UI.
3) Put protocol-facing behavior behind testable helpers; avoid burying contract logic inside screen components.
4) Keep first-party modules as examples of SDK usage, not the only way to access protocol capabilities.

## SDK operating mode (third-party build ready)

- SDK implementation is complete and release-automated. Operate in maintenance/release mode using:
  - `docs/sdk/README.md` (current start points and release commands)
  - `docs/sdk/test-gates.md` (required tests and release quality gates)
  - `docs/sdk/changelog.md` (tracked delivery history)
- Historical planning docs are archived in `docs/sdk/archive/`.
- Maintenance loop for SDK increments:
  1. Implement changes in `packages/xtrata-sdk` and/or `packages/xtrata-reconstruction`.
  2. Add or update tests in the same change set.
  3. Update quickstarts, compatibility notes, and troubleshooting when behavior changes.
  4. Run `npm run sdk:release:dry-run`.
  5. Regenerate and commit `docs/sdk/changelog.md`.
- Minimum quality bar for merged SDK work:
  - Unit coverage for new public helpers.
  - Integration or smoke test coverage for affected workflows.
  - Example usage that can run in a clean environment.
  - Documentation updates for developer onboarding and migration impact.

## Top-level layout and navigation

- `index.html` is the active public homepage entry point. It is a self-contained inline HTML/CSS/JS app, so homepage-facing copy, layout, wallet, viewer, and inscription-flow changes must be applied here when they are meant to affect the public home experience.
- `src/App.tsx` owns the main layout, section order, anchor buttons, collapse state, deploy panel, and high-level app state wiring.
- `src/styles/app.css` owns layout tokens, widths, grid sizing, square preview frames, and global layout rules.
- `src/main.tsx` boots the app and wires providers (React Query) and global CSS.
- `src/lib/theme/preferences.ts` owns theme mode catalog/persistence and document-level theme application.

## Public homepage

- The root `index.html` now carries the public homepage UI directly with inline styles and scripts, including homepage wallet connect, inscription preparation, transaction logs, viewer grid, token preview, examples, and explorer mode.
- Treat `src/PublicApp.tsx`/`src/SimplePublicHome.tsx` as React public-app references or alternate surfaces, not the only homepage implementation. If a requested change affects public homepage behavior or wording, make the effective change in `index.html` and mirror it in React modules only when those modules still expose the same user-facing surface.
- For inscription UX changes, keep the homepage inline mint flow aligned with `src/screens/MintScreen.tsx`: preserve begin -> batch/chunk -> seal order, keep resume/recovery messaging consistent, and do not hide errors.

## Screens and shared UI

- `src/screens/MintScreen.tsx` owns mint UI, file selection, cost/fee display, mint flow steps, and mint preview.
- `src/screens/CollectionMintScreen.tsx` owns batch mint UI (multi-file upload + batch seal) into the core contract.
- `src/screens/CollectionMintAdminScreen.tsx` owns collection-mint admin UI (per-collection settings + core allowlist).
- `src/screens/PreinscribedCollectionAdminScreen.tsx` owns pre-inscribed escrow sale admin UI (sale settings, allowlist, and inventory operations).
- `src/screens/PreinscribedCollectionSaleScreen.tsx` owns the pre-inscribed sale buyer UI in admin app context (sale status, token availability checks, and buy flow).
- `src/screens/CampaignConsoleScreen.tsx` owns the campaign console (drafts, assets, AI copy, post runner).
- `src/screens/ViewerScreen.tsx` owns the collection viewer grid, selection logic, and detailed preview panel.
- `src/screens/MyWalletScreen.tsx` owns the wallet grid, pagination, selection, and wallet preview panel.
- `src/screens/MarketScreen.tsx` owns the aggregate market browser (STX, USDCx, and sBTC listing filters), selected-listing detail view, and advanced direct market actions.
- `src/screens/CommerceScreen.tsx` owns the dedicated USDCx commerce UI (contract selection, listing lookup, listing creation, purchase, and entitlement checks).
- `src/screens/PublicCommerceScreen.tsx` wraps the public-facing commerce view around the default registry contract.
- `src/screens/VaultScreen.tsx` owns the dedicated sBTC vault UI (contract selection, vault lookup, tier checks, premium access checks, and owner vault actions).
- `src/components/TokenCardMedia.tsx` renders grid cell media (image/audio/video/html/text) and handles per-token loading.
- `src/components/TokenContentPreview.tsx` renders the large preview, resolves content, and exposes preview actions.

## Artist manager portal

- `src/config/manage.ts` defines `MANAGE_PATH`, parses `VITE_ARTIST_ALLOWLIST`, and exposes helpers for the gate; the same allowlist drives the `/manage` entry point.
- `src/manage/ArtistManagerGate.tsx` handles wallet connect/disconnect, theme selection, and allowlist validation before rendering `CollectionManagerApp`.
- `src/manage/ManageWalletContext.tsx` reuses the shared wallet adapter/session store to isolate the manage portal session from the public app.
- `src/manage/CollectionManagerApp.tsx` composes the collapse-aware panels (`SdkToolkitPanel`, `CollectionListPanel`, `OwnerOversightPanel`, `DeployWizardPanel`, `CollectionSettingsPanel`, `AssetStagingPanel`, `PublishOpsPanel`, and `DiagnosticsPanel`).
- `src/manage/components/SdkToolkitPanel.tsx` provides quick-start guidance, context-aware SDK snippets, and allowlist boundary notes for third-party builders.
- `functions/collections/*` responds to the `CollectionList`/`CollectionRecord` endpoints, deploy/readiness checks, asset manifest uploads, reservation CRUD, publish action, owner oversight snapshots, and R2 upload URLs using the `DB`/`COLLECTION_ASSETS` bindings (legacy fallbacks: `ASSETS`, `R2`).
- `functions/collections/[collectionId]/fee-guidance.ts` serves backend mining-fee guidance (begin/upload/seal estimates) based on the largest staged asset chunk profile.
- `functions/lib/collections.ts` implements slug normalization and storage-limit helpers; `functions/lib/__tests__/collections.test.ts` guards them via Vitest.
- `functions/lib/fee-guidance.ts` owns chunk-based mining-fee assumptions and estimate generation for collection guidance responses.
- `functions/lib/collection-deploy.ts` validates whether a draft has a confirmed on-chain deploy transaction before upload/publish operations.
- `functions/collections/health.ts` provides the `/collections/health` check used by the diagnostics panel to confirm D1 connectivity, table counts, storage bindings, and runtime inscription cache budget warnings.

## Update types (simple -> complex)

1) Text copy, labels, and button titles.
Files: `index.html`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/screens/MintScreen.tsx`, `src/screens/ViewerScreen.tsx`, `src/screens/MyWalletScreen.tsx`, `src/components/TokenContentPreview.tsx`, `src/PublicApp.tsx`, `src/SimplePublicHome.tsx`.
Notes: prefer in-place edits; keep strings short for tight layouts. If the copy appears on the public homepage, the effective change must be present in `index.html`.

2) Layout spacing, widths, and overall page density.
Files: `index.html`, `src/styles/app.css`, `src/App.tsx`.
Notes: use CSS variables and layout classes where available; for the homepage, update the inline CSS in `index.html`. Avoid horizontal shifts and preserve stable responsive widths.

3) Grid layout, square sizing, and preview sizing for viewer or wallet.
Files: `src/styles/app.css`, `src/screens/ViewerScreen.tsx`, `src/screens/MyWalletScreen.tsx`, `src/components/TokenCardMedia.tsx`, `src/components/TokenContentPreview.tsx`.
Notes: keep the square frame constraints in CSS and only control selection in screens.

4) Add or reorder modules/sections in the UI.
Files: `src/App.tsx`, `src/styles/app.css`.
Notes: add anchors and collapse wiring if a new module is added.

5) Contract list changes or new default contract.
Files: `src/data/contract-registry.json`, `src/lib/contract/registry.ts`, `src/lib/contract/selection.ts`.
Notes: keep contract id formatting consistent with `getContractId`.

5a) Contract read-only additions (protocol helpers or diagnostics).
Files: `docs/contract-inventory.md`, `src/lib/contract/client.ts`, `src/lib/protocol/parsers.ts`.
Notes: add helpers as read-only calls, ensure parsers and docs are updated.

6) Deploy flow UI and deploy logic updates.
Files: `src/App.tsx`, `src/lib/contract/client.ts`, `src/lib/network/stacks.ts`, `src/lib/wallet/adapter.ts`.
Notes: deploy UI lives in App; transaction building lives in contract client.

7) Wallet connect, disconnect, and session persistence changes.
Files: `src/lib/wallet/session.ts`, `src/lib/wallet/storage.ts`, `src/lib/wallet/adapter.ts`, `src/App.tsx`.
Notes: session persistence is separated from UI state and should stay that way.

8) Mint flow changes (file validation, hashing, fee logic, transaction steps).
Files: `index.html`, `src/screens/MintScreen.tsx`, `src/lib/chunking/hash.ts`, `src/lib/protocol/clarity.ts`, `src/lib/contract/client.ts`, `src/lib/wallet/adapter.ts`.
Notes: keep the three-step mint flow in MintScreen and the inline homepage flow; avoid hiding errors. User-facing recovery/resume copy must stay supportive and consistent across both surfaces.

9) Viewer data fetching, caching, and content decoding.
Files: `src/lib/viewer/queries.ts`, `src/lib/viewer/content.ts`, `src/lib/viewer/cache.ts`, `src/components/TokenCardMedia.tsx`, `src/components/TokenContentPreview.tsx`.
Notes: cache key changes must update both cache and queries.

10) Protocol parsing or contract read-only response changes.
Files: `src/lib/protocol/parsers.ts`, `src/lib/protocol/types.ts`, `src/lib/contract/read-only.ts`.
Notes: add or update tests in `src/lib/protocol/__tests__/`.

11) Network changes or new endpoint configuration.
Files: `src/lib/network/config.ts`, `src/lib/network/stacks.ts`, `src/lib/network/types.ts`.
Notes: ensure tests or guards in `src/lib/network/__tests__/` still pass.

## API keys and env notes (local + Pages)

- **Hiro API key**
  - Local dev: set `HIRO_API_KEYS` (comma/newline list) in `.env.local`; fallback supports `HIRO_API_KEY`.
  - Pages Functions: set runtime env keys for `/functions/hiro`:
    - preferred: `HIRO_API_KEYS` list
    - optional numbered fallback: `HIRO_API_KEY_1`, `HIRO_API_KEY_2`, ...
    - legacy single key: `HIRO_API_KEY`
  - On `401/403/429`, the proxy tries the next configured Hiro key automatically.
  - Optional build flag: `VITE_HIRO_API_KEY` only indicates key presence in the UI.
  - Pages note: set variables for both **Production** and **Preview** environments
    (the `*.pages.dev` URL uses Preview) to avoid 429s on preview builds.
- **BNS resolution proxies**
  - BNS name/address resolution prefers BNSv2 APIs first, then Hiro name APIs, then Explorer HTML fallback.
  - `/functions/bnsv2/[network]/[[path]].ts` proxies BNSv2 API requests.
  - Optional BNSv2 overrides: `VITE_BNSV2_API_BASE`, `VITE_BNSV2_API_BASE_MAINNET`, `VITE_BNSV2_API_BASE_TESTNET`.
  - Pages Functions runtime overrides: `BNSV2_API_BASE_MAINNET`, `BNSV2_API_BASE_TESTNET`.
  - `/functions/explorer` remains the HTML fallback path.
  - Optional Explorer overrides: `VITE_STACKS_EXPLORER_BASE`, `VITE_STACKS_EXPLORER_BASE_MAINNET`, `VITE_STACKS_EXPLORER_BASE_TESTNET`.
  - Explorer runtime override: `STACKS_EXPLORER_BASE`.
12) New media types or preview behavior.
Files: `src/components/TokenCardMedia.tsx`, `src/components/TokenContentPreview.tsx`, `src/lib/viewer/content.ts`.
Notes: keep rendering logic consistent between grid and preview.

13) SDK surface additions (types, client wrappers, reusable flows).
Files: `docs/sdk/*.md`, `packages/xtrata-sdk/**`, `src/lib/contract/**`, `src/lib/protocol/**`.
Notes: define stable interfaces and error models before UI adoption.

14) Reconstruction library work (deterministic assembly and verification).
Files: `packages/xtrata-reconstruction/**`, `src/lib/viewer/content.ts`, `src/lib/chunking/hash.ts`, `docs/sdk/compatibility-matrix.md`.
Notes: keep outputs deterministic and independently verifiable.

15) Third-party starter integrations and examples.
Files: `examples/**`, `docs/sdk/README.md`, `docs/sdk/quickstart-first-30-minutes.md`.
Notes: examples must prove end-to-end integration with minimal custom code.

16) SDK hardening and release readiness.
Files: `docs/sdk/test-gates.md`, `docs/sdk/changelog.md`, `docs/sdk/release-notes-template.md`, `packages/xtrata-sdk/**`, `packages/xtrata-reconstruction/**`, `examples/**`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/sdk-release.yml`.
Notes: every phase must add tests and pass defined release gates before progressing.
