## V1 Contract Rules

- `93` tiles: `u0..u92`.
- Styled `(string-ascii 96)` `B1` programmes.
- Canonical `X0000` clear programmes.
- `1 STX` minimum initial bid.
- `1%` protocol fee.
- Rounded-up `1%` minimum outbid.
- Refundable owner lock.
- Release remains available while paused.
- Every mutation must be called directly by a wallet.
- Protocol fees can be withdrawn only to standard wallet principals.
- `get-tile-page` returns at most `10` entries.

The proxy contract is test infrastructure only. Do not deploy it with the
production registry.
