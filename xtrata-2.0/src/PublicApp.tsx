    description: 'A full onboarding path from first wallet connection to your first verified inscription.',
    content: `## Getting started end-to-end
Xtrata is designed so you can move from zero setup to a fully sealed, viewable inscription in one session.

### Before you begin
- Connect a wallet and confirm the network matches the active contract.
- Prepare a file that is ready for permanent on-chain storage.
- Decide if this mint is a personal piece, a collection release, or a partner batch.

### First-time walkthrough
- Step 1: Open Wallet, connect, and confirm your address and network.
- Step 2: Open Viewer and scan existing inscriptions to understand output format.
- Step 3: Open Mint, select your file, and review mime type and size.
- Step 4: Run Begin to register content intent.
- Step 5: Upload all batch chunks until progress reaches completion.
- Step 6: Seal to finalize hash and publish the inscription ID.
- Step 7: Return to Viewer and confirm content renders from on-chain data.

### What a successful mint looks like
- You receive a transaction for Begin, one or more batch transactions, and a final Seal transaction.
- Viewer resolves metadata and displays media without fallback mismatch.
- The inscription appears in collection mode and wallet mode.`

    id: 'inscriptions',
    title: 'How inscriptions work',
    tag: 'Protocol',
    description: 'What is committed on-chain, how chunking is verified, and how rendering is determined.',
    content: `## On-chain inscription model
An inscription is not only metadata. The actual content bytes are committed in chunked form and finalized with a deterministic hash.

### Core fields and what they mean
- Creator: wallet that finalized the inscription flow.
- Mime type: rendering hint for grid and preview components.
- Total size: expected byte size of the final assembled payload.
- Total chunks: expected chunk count used for completeness checks.
- Final hash: integrity commitment over ordered chunk data.

### Lifecycle integrity
- Begin establishes the expected content shape.
- Batch uploads fill chunk indexes with deterministic order.
- Seal verifies completion and locks the final record.

### Why this design is resilient
- Chunking keeps write operations bounded and reliable.
- Hash finalization gives deterministic content verification.
- Rendering can switch between thumbnail, cached preview, and full content while preserving identity.

### Practical implications for creators
- Mime type accuracy improves downstream viewer behavior.
- Consistent pre-processing (compression, export settings) reduces upload risk.
- A sealed inscription can be validated independently from off-chain hosting.`

    description: 'How token identity remains continuous across versions and what migration does not change.',
    content: `## Continuous identity across versions
Xtrata preserves a single collection identity over contract generations. IDs keep historical meaning instead of restarting per version.

### Compatibility guarantees
- Existing v1 IDs remain valid and discoverable.
- v2 mints continue from the next available index.
- Wallet ownership and market visibility can be reasoned about without remapping IDs.

### Operational effects in app flows
- Viewer can render legacy and current ranges under one browsing model.
- Listing resolution can include both current and legacy contract sources.
- Activity timelines remain understandable because token numbers are stable.

### What migration changes
- Access to newer tooling and flows.
- Potentially improved upload/view behaviors.

### What migration does not change
- The historical existence of the original inscription ID.
- The provenance sequence that already occurred.
- The need to verify escrow and ownership state before market actions.

### Migration planning tips
- Test a small subset first.
- Validate viewer parity (thumbnail + full preview).
- Re-check market status after transfers or relisting.`

    content: `## Minting mode selection guide
Xtrata supports multiple mint paths so creators, teams, and partner collections can use the same base protocol with different operational workflows.

### Direct mint
- Best for individual artists and collectors.
- Uses Begin, Batch, Seal per inscription.
- Highest control over each piece and metadata decision.

### Batch mint workflow
- Best for multi-asset drops and production publishing.
- Groups repeated steps to reduce repetitive operator actions.
- Improves consistency for large release sessions.

### Partner collection contracts
- External collection logic can enforce pricing, allowlists, and split rules.
- Mint output still lands in Xtrata-compatible inscription flows.
- Operator controls can remain compact while preserving protocol safety.

### Choosing the right mode
- Use direct mint when quality control per item is the priority.
- Use batch mint when throughput and consistency are the priority.
- Use partner collection contracts when distribution rules must be encoded.

### Release checklist regardless of mode
- Validate network and contract targeting.
- Pre-calculate expected fees and batch count.
- Define recovery steps for interrupted sessions.
- Confirm final Viewer rendering for multiple sample assets.`

    description: 'Plain-language guide to choose between collection mint and pre-inscribed sale, then launch safely.',
    content: `## Artist collection launch guide
This section is a plain-language reference for artists and collection teams.

### Two collection sale formats
- **Collection mint**: buyers mint new inscriptions during your sale.
- **Pre-inscribed sale**: you pre-inscribe first, then buyers purchase token IDs from escrow inventory.

### When to use collection mint
- You want a live mint event.
- You want buyers to mint directly at purchase time.
- You want flexible launch rules (price, limits, phases, allowlist, splits).

### When to use pre-inscribed sale
- You want full quality control before launch.
- You want no buyer-side file upload during checkout.
- You want fixed inventory drops where buyers purchase existing IDs.

### Contracts and modules
- Core NFT contract: \`xtrata-v2-1-0\`
- Collection mint contract template: \`xtrata-collection-mint-v1.4\`
- Pre-inscribed sale contract template: \`xtrata-preinscribed-collection-sale-v1.0\`
- Admin module: Collection mint admin
- Admin module: Pre-inscribed sale admin
- Buyer flow: Mint / collection mint flows
- Buyer flow: Pre-inscribed sale buyer flow

### Setup checklist before launch
- Confirm wallet network and contract network match.
- Confirm contract IDs are correct.
- Set recipients and verify split total = \`10000\` bps.
- Set price, allowlist mode, and per-wallet limits.
- Set pause state and sale window carefully.
- Run a small test launch before the full drop.

### File handling model
- Collection mint: buyers typically upload files during mint; the app chunks and writes on-chain.
- Pre-inscribed sale: no buyer upload during sale; assets are already inscribed and sold by token ID.

### Safety habits
- Keep one admin wallet dedicated to launch operations.
- Record all launch tx IDs for audit and troubleshooting.
- If anything looks wrong, pause first, then verify settings and inventory.

    title: 'SDK in artist + manage portal',
    tag: 'SDK',
    description:
      'How the manage portal and allowlist connect to production-ready SDK tooling for third-party builders.',
    content: `## SDK integration model
Xtrata's creator portal is the no-code control layer. The SDK is the reusable build layer for third-party apps.

### What this means in practice
- Artists can launch and manage drops in \`/manage\` without touching raw contract code.
- Builders can use SDK clients and workflows to power their own marketplaces, game loops, and launch pages.
- Both paths run on the same protocol and contract rules.

### Who this section is for
- Artists: understand what the portal does for you and what stays configurable.
- Builders: understand how to integrate protocol reads/writes into your own app.
- Operators: understand allowlist boundaries and controlled rollout flow.
- Collectors and curious users: understand what is open now vs partner-gated.

### Allowlist and access boundaries
- Allowlist is for artist-management actions in \`/manage\` (deploy, publish, and contract-level controls).
- SDK read integrations are open to any builder.
- Production write flows should use deterministic workflow planners with deny-mode post-condition defaults.

### Recommended SDK path
- Start with \`@xtrata/sdk/simple\` for low-friction reads.
- Add \`@xtrata/sdk/workflows\` for mint/list/buy/cancel transaction planning.
- Use advanced modules only for custom orchestration or custom deployment tooling.

### Why this matters for ecosystem growth
- First-party pages remain a reference implementation.
- Third parties can launch branded UX while still settling against Xtrata contracts.
- Protocol improvements land once and benefit every integrated app.

### Partner access (invite to apply)
- Partner access is currently curated while the rollout stays high-quality and supportable.
- If you are building a marketplace, game, launchpad, or creator tool on top of Xtrata, you are encouraged to apply.
- Include:
  - your product/use-case summary
  - target launch timeline
  - the wallet addresses you want allowlisted for \`/manage\`
  - the contract flow you plan to use (collection mint, pre-inscribed sale, market, or mixed)
- Apply via the official channels in External references (\`@XtrataLayers\` on X and GitHub).

- SDK start point: \`docs/sdk/README.md\`
- Beginner path: \`docs/sdk/quickstart-simple-mode.md\`

    content: `## Listing lifecycle in practice
Listings rely on escrow transfer so buyers can trust settlement rules at purchase time.

### State model
- Escrowed: owner is market contract and listing is actionable.
- Stale: listing record exists but token owner changed.
- Unknown: temporary resolution gap while data catches up.

### Seller workflow
- Create listing from a wallet-owned token.
- Confirm listing appears as escrowed before sharing.
- Cancel immediately if listing becomes stale after side transfers.

### Buyer workflow
- Verify escrowed status and listing price.
- Use buy action with post-condition protection.
- Re-check ownership in viewer after purchase confirmation.

### Why escrow checks matter
- Prevents purchasing against invalid ownership state.
- Reduces stale listing confusion in high-activity collections.
- Keeps market UI aligned with on-chain truth.

### Practical hygiene
- Refresh active listings before major actions.
- Prefer card-level quick actions tied to resolved listing data.
- Treat stale status as a signal to cancel/relist, not as a temporary visual bug.`

Xtrata aligns with established Stacks standards to keep wallet/indexer interoperability predictable.

### SIP-009 in operations
- Defines ownership and transfer semantics for NFTs.
- Market escrow and cancel logic depend on consistent SIP-009 ownership reads.
- Wallet tools use SIP-009 assumptions to validate list/cancel/transfer readiness.

### SIP-016 in discovery
- Defines token URI behavior and metadata structure expectations.
- Viewer and external indexers use token URI as a compatible metadata entry point.
- Fallback behavior is safer when SIP-016 fields are consistent.

### Recursive inscription patterns
- An inscription can reference other on-chain content for composability.
- Useful for modular art, dynamic assembly, or shared media components.
- Viewer dependency checks keep recursive rendering safer and more transparent.

### Interop best practices
- Keep mime type and URI metadata internally consistent.
- Avoid introducing non-standard schema changes without compatibility layers.
- Validate behavior in at least one external wallet/indexer path before release.`

Mint costs come from protocol operation count plus base chain mining fees.

### Components that affect total spend
- Begin transaction cost.
- Number of batch upload calls required by file size/chunking.
- Seal transaction and seal fee unit multipliers.
- Chain mining conditions at submit time.

### Estimation mindset
- Treat the total as operation cost plus variable network cost.
- Larger files increase batch count, which increases execution and submission overhead.
- Session interruptions can increase retries, so conservative fee planning matters.

### Reducing avoidable cost
- Compress and optimize assets before mint.
- Prefer stable network periods for large drop sessions.
- Validate one sample file first, then scale.

### Team release practice
- Define a per-file budget band ahead of launch.
- Track actual vs expected cost for first few mints.
- Adjust chunking/file prep policy before full release.`

- Announce maintenance windows before impactful changes.
- Apply one class of change at a time.
- Verify network/contract targeting before every privileged transaction.

### Safety practices
- Pause before migrations or emergency interventions.
- Keep allowlists minimal and auditable.
- Validate post-change behavior in viewer, market, and mint modules.

The viewer is designed to stay responsive while resolving full on-chain media.

### Grid and preview are linked
- The grid loads token summaries and lightweight media first.
- The preview resolves richer content for the selected token.
- Listing state is merged from market activity and targeted read-only checks.

### Cache-first behavior
- IndexedDB stores thumbnails and resolved content.
- React Query prevents unnecessary refetches.
- Recent pages are remembered to warm cache when returning to the viewer.

### UX safeguards
- Square grid constraints are preserved across breakpoints.
- Preview keeps the selected art visible while metadata/tools scroll separately.
- Network retries stay bounded to avoid aggressive polling.

### Performance behavior you should expect
- First visit to a page may show staged loading while metadata and content resolve.
- Revisits should be significantly faster when cache entries are warm.
- Large files can display thumbnail first and full data once resolved.

### Operational tuning principles
- Prefer cache-first lookup before triggering fresh reads.

### Network guard behavior
- Contract/network mismatches are surfaced before transaction calls.

### Wallet lookup and viewing
- You can view holdings by connected wallet or looked-up address/name.
- BNS lookup resolves names to addresses before wallet-mode filtering.
- Viewer mode and wallet mode share listing-aware rendering logic.

### Safe transaction posture
- Buy/cancel/list actions apply post-conditions where relevant.
- Seller-only cancel and owner-only list validations are enforced in UI before wallet prompt.

### Session and UX expectations
- Connected wallet identity and lookup identity can differ by design.
- Wallet mode should clearly signal which address is currently being viewed.
- Actions should remain blocked until all guards pass.

- Resolve network mismatch before debugging transaction errors.
- Confirm selected contract context before signing.

If something looks wrong, start with these checks in order.

### 1) Confirm network alignment
- Wallet network must match active contract network.
- Market contract network must match the active NFT contract.

### 2) Confirm listing state
- If a listing is stale, owner is no longer the market contract.
- Use active listings + selected listing detail to verify escrow status.

### 3) Confirm content path
- Thumbnail can load before full media.
- Large content may appear after staged chunk resolution.
- Cached pages should load faster after first visit.

### 4) Retry safely
- Refresh active listings/market activity.
- Re-open wallet prompt only after status confirms prerequisites.
- If a tx fails post-condition, no protected asset transfer occurs.

### Minting-specific checks
- Confirm Begin succeeded before retrying batch uploads.
- Validate expected chunk count against file size assumptions.
- If Seal fails, inspect whether all chunks are actually present.

### Viewer-specific checks
- Distinguish thumbnail success from full media success.
- Confirm selected token metadata includes expected mime type.
- Re-open the same token after cache warmup to isolate transient load issues.

### Market-specific checks
- Verify seller address matches connected wallet for cancel flow.
- Verify listing owner is market contract before buy flow.
- Treat stale listings as state issues, not UI rendering issues.

### Escalation path
- Capture tx IDs, listing IDs, token IDs, and wallet/network context.
- Reproduce with one minimal token example.
- Escalate with exact reproduction steps and observed vs expected behavior.`,
