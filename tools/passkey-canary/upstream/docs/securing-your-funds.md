# Securing your funds

This page is for two audiences:

- **If you use an app built on this library** — start at [The short
  version](#the-short-version) and read through [If you lose
  access](#if-you-lose-access).
- **If you are integrating this library** — read all of it, then the
  [integrator checklist](#integrator-checklist) at the end.

Nothing here is a promise about your funds. It is a description of how this
wallet actually works and what that means for you.

## The short version

1. This is a **hot wallet**. Same security class as a browser-extension wallet.
   Suitable for onboarding and everyday amounts. Not for savings or a treasury.
2. **Your passkey provider — Apple or Google — can reach your funds.** Whoever
   can restore your iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager can re-derive
   this wallet. Secure that account as if it were the wallet, because it is.
3. **Export your seed phrase and write it down.** It is the only recovery path
   that does not depend on your passkey provider.
4. **"Add a passkey" is not a backup.** It is a second way to sign in. Only the
   seed phrase recovers funds.

## What kind of wallet this is

The wallet's private key is derived from your passkey each time it is needed,
used, and then let go of — the library overwrites the key buffers it holds, and
the derived pieces it hands to the signing code are dropped to the browser's
garbage collector rather than overwritten (`src/memory.ts` marks that
boundary). Deriving and signing happen in the web page you are using — so at
the moment you sign, the key exists in that page's memory.

That has two consequences worth being plain about:

- **Malware on your device** at signing time could read the key. This is true of
  every browser-based wallet, extension wallets included.
- **You are trusting the app's website.** The code that derives your key is
  JavaScript served by whoever runs that site. A compromised or malicious build
  of the app could take the key material. A passkey does not change this — it
  changes how you *log in*, not who is running the code.

The passkey genuinely improves things: there is no seed phrase to write down at
signup, and passkey login is phishing-resistant in a way passwords are not. It
does not make a web wallet into a hardware wallet.

## Who can reach your funds

Three parties are inside the trust boundary:

| Who | Why | What you can do |
|---|---|---|
| **You**, on your device | The key is derived and used locally | Keep the device patched; be careful about browser extensions |
| **Your passkey provider** (Apple / Google) | Passkeys sync, and the passkey *is* the key material | Strong password, 2FA, and careful recovery-contact setup on that account |
| **The app's operator** | Serves the code that derives your key | Prefer apps you would trust with a browser-extension wallet |

The passkey-provider point is the one most people miss, so it is worth stating
directly. In many passkey systems the passkey only *signs* a challenge and the
key never leaves the provider's secure hardware in a spendable form. **This
library is different**: it uses the passkey's PRF output as the seed for a
standard HD wallet. That is what lets you restore into Leather or Xverse with a
normal 24-word phrase — and it is also why anyone who can restore your Apple or
Google account can re-derive the same wallet.

There is no DeOrganized or vendor recovery path. That is a separate claim from
provider custody, and both are true at once: no company here can recover your
wallet for you, *and* your passkey provider is effectively a custodian.

## "Add a passkey" vs "Restore my wallet"

These two actions look similar in an interface and mean completely different
things. Conflating them is the most likely way to lose funds with this wallet.

**"Add a passkey" — login convenience.**
Another way to sign in to the **same** wallet, using a passkey synced by the
**same** provider. It does not back anything up. If you lose access to that
provider account, every passkey it holds goes with it.

**"Restore my wallet" — funds recovery.**
Re-deriving your wallet from your **exported seed phrase**, on any device or in
any standard wallet. This is the only action that recovers funds.

A genuinely *new* passkey — a different provider, or an unsynced device —
derives a **different, empty wallet**. Not access to your original one. Same
person, same app, different passkey: different funds.

Concretely: a passkey in Google Password Manager and a passkey in iCloud
Keychain are two separate credentials, and therefore two separate wallets. They
do not merge.

## Backing up: the seed phrase

Your wallet has a standard 24-word BIP-39 recovery phrase. Exporting it is the
one thing on this page that you should go do now if you have not.

**How the export works.** The app confirms to the library that it showed you a
warning first (`acknowledgedBackupWarning`), and you must re-authenticate with
your passkey at that moment — the library will not produce the phrase without
that fresh passkey ceremony. The phrase is then handed to the app **once**; the
library forgets it immediately and never sends, logs, or stores it. What the app
does with the phrase after that — display it, clear it, dismiss it — is the
app's responsibility. If you close the screen without writing it down, you can
run the export again — but each run produces it exactly once.

**How to store it.**

- Write it on paper. Two copies, two locations.
- Do not photograph it, type it into notes, email it to yourself, or paste it
  into a chat or a password field. A phrase in cloud storage is a phrase in
  whatever account holds that storage.
- Never type it into any website. No legitimate support process will ask for it.
  This app will not ask you to enter a phrase to "verify" it.

**Two things about this phrase that differ from a normal wallet:**

1. **It is a second, independent way in.** Once written down, the paper reaches
   your funds even without the passkey. Anyone who finds it has the wallet.
2. **It cannot be rotated.** The phrase is derived deterministically from your
   passkey, so you cannot issue a new phrase for the same wallet. If a phrase is
   exposed, the only remedy is to move the funds to a different wallet.

## Passkey providers: what to check

Byte-identical passkey output across your devices is the assumption this whole
design rests on. Not every provider or version delivers it.

| Provider | Works for this wallet | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **iCloud Keychain** | Yes, on iOS/iPadOS **18.4+** and macOS **15.4+** | Earlier versions could derive inconsistently across devices. The library's user-agent check refuses recognized iOS/iPadOS agents below the floor rather than risk it; it is not a capability probe, and agents it does not recognize pass through to WebAuthn's own errors. |
| **Google Password Manager** | Yes | Chrome/Edge 116+, desktop and Android. On by default; the broadest option, and the recommended one on Windows. |
| **Windows Hello** | No | The credential never leaves that one PC. `createPasskey()` rejects it before deriving; the sign-in (`get()`) path applies no such gate today — see [#13](https://github.com/DeOrganized/stacks-passkey-wallet/issues/13) and [`get-vs-create-ambiguity.md`](./get-vs-create-ambiguity.md#checking-backup-eligibility-on-the-get-path). |
| **Hardware security keys** | No | Same reason — device-bound, and the same create-only gate. |
| **Firefox on Android, Android WebView** | No | No passkey PRF support. |

Practical caveats:

- **Sync must actually be on.** A passkey that never syncs is a single-device
  wallet, and losing the device means the seed phrase is your only way back.
- **Providers do not interoperate.** You cannot move a passkey from Google to
  Apple and arrive at the same wallet. Use the seed phrase to move.
- **Provider account changes propagate.** Losing your Apple ID or Google account
  — closure, lockout, recovery by someone else — takes the passkey with it.
- Cross-device and cross-provider coverage is still being verified by hand. See
  [`prf-support-matrix.md`](./prf-support-matrix.md) and
  [`prf-verification-checklist.md`](./prf-verification-checklist.md) for what has
  actually been confirmed on real devices, as opposed to what the specs promise.

## What this library never stores

The library holds no persistent state at all:

- **No seed, key, or phrase in `localStorage`, `IndexedDB`, cookies, or any
  other browser storage.** The seed is re-derived on demand and lives only in
  page memory. The HD root and the byte buffers the library holds are zeroized
  after use; derived child keys and string values are released to garbage
  collection, not overwritten (`src/memory.ts` states that boundary).
- **Nothing is transmitted.** The library sends no key material to any server —
  not DeOrganized's, not anyone's. There is no telemetry.
- **The exported phrase is reveal-once.** The export object redacts itself on
  string coercion and `JSON.stringify`, so those accidental paths do not carry
  the phrase; once `reveal()` has handed it over, handling it is the app's
  responsibility.

What an app built on the library *will* normally store is your **addresses** —
which are public information — so it can show your balance. That is expected and
is not key material.

## How much to keep in this wallet

Treat it like the cash in your pocket, not the money in your bank.

Reasonable: onboarding, small purchases, tips, day-to-day balances you would be
annoyed but not harmed to lose.

Not reasonable: savings, treasury funds, anything you cannot afford to lose, or
anything held on behalf of other people.

**If a balance outgrows that, move the funds out to a wallet generated on a
hardware device.** Do not import *this* phrase into a hardware wallet and
consider the problem solved — that phrase has already existed in browser memory
and remains derivable from your passkey, so importing it carries the original
exposure along with it. A hardware wallet only helps if its key was generated on
the hardware and has never left it. Send the funds; do not move the phrase.

## If you lose access

- **Lost or wiped your device, passkey still synced** — sign in on another
  device with the same provider account. Same wallet.
- **Lost access to the passkey provider account** — use your seed phrase in any
  standard wallet (Leather, Xverse, or similar).
- **No passkey and no seed phrase** — the funds are not recoverable. Not by you,
  not by the app operator, not by anyone. This is what self-custody means, and it
  is why the phrase matters.

**When you restore into another wallet**, some wallets scan more than one
multi-account convention and will show you **two accounts for the same phrase**.
That is expected. Your funds are on the **first** account. Match the address
type when you check: `bc1q…` (native SegWit) for Bitcoin, `SP…` for Stacks. There
is no BIP-39 passphrase on this wallet — leave that field empty.

## Integrator checklist

Everything above is the user-facing contract. Keeping it true is on you.

**Do not weaken the built-in gates.**

- Seed export requires a fresh `get()` and an explicit
  `acknowledgedBackupWarning`; this is the only path the library exposes. Set
  that flag only after the user has actually passed your warning UI — not as a
  constructor default.
- `SeedExport.reveal()` yields the phrase once. Do not cache the result, store
  it, or pass it to anything that persists or transmits.
- `createPasskey()` rejects device-bound authenticators before deriving. Do not
  work around this to "support Windows Hello" — the result would be a
  single-device wallet the user cannot restore.

**Keep the two actions distinct.** Use `WALLET_ACTIONS` as the source of truth
for the copy. "Add a passkey" must never be presented as a backup, and your
backup prompt must never be satisfied by adding a passkey.

**Do not auto-create on a failed sign-in.** WebAuthn deliberately cannot
distinguish "user cancelled" from "no credential", so calling `create()` after a
failed `get()` silently produces a second, empty wallet. Use the get()-first,
confirm-before-create pattern in
[`get-vs-create-ambiguity.md`](./get-vs-create-ambiguity.md).

**Never build a "type your phrase here" surface** except a deliberate,
clearly-labelled restore flow. Teaching users that entering a phrase into a
website is normal is teaching them to fall for the next phishing site.

**Your page is inside the trust boundary.** The key is derived in your app's
JavaScript context. Treat wallet pages accordingly: a strict Content Security
Policy, no third-party scripts or analytics on pages that derive or sign,
reviewed dependencies, and pinned versions. Pin this library to an exact version
— it is pre-1.0 and breaking changes may land in minor releases.

**Do not add key material to your logging or error reporting.** The library
redacts its own export object; it cannot redact a variable you captured
yourself.

**Verify on your target providers before you launch.** The PRF support matrix is
incomplete. If your users are on a combination that has not been confirmed
end-to-end, confirm it yourself with
[`prf-verification-checklist.md`](./prf-verification-checklist.md) before funds
depend on it.

**Tell your users what is in this document.** Not as a link in a footer — the
provider-custody point and the add-passkey-is-not-a-backup point belong in the
flow, at the moment they matter.
