# WebAuthn PRF support matrix (living doc)

Seeded from the initial PRF diagnosis (V4, 2026-07-14); completed during later
hardening. A passkey wallet needs **byte-identical PRF output across all of a
user's synced devices** — that is the axis that matters here, not just "does PRF
run."

> **Verified-by-hand results** live in the companion
> [`prf-verification-checklist.md`](./prf-verification-checklist.md). This file records
> capability per spec and provider docs; that file records what has actually been
> confirmed end-to-end on real devices.

## Browser engine — does `getClientExtensionResults().prf.results` return bytes?

| Engine | PRF | Since |
|---|---|---|
| Chrome / Edge desktop | ✅ | 116 (Aug 2023) |
| Safari desktop (macOS) | ✅ | 18.0 (Sep 2024) |
| Chrome on Android | ✅ | 116 |
| Safari iOS/iPadOS | ✅ (reliable cross-device **18.4+**) | 18.0; floor 18.4 |
| Firefox desktop | ✅ | 139 (May 2025) |
| Firefox Android / Android WebView | ❌ | — |

## Provider — PRF **and** byte-identical across synced devices?

| Provider | PRF | Synced-consistent | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **iCloud Keychain** | ✅ | ✅ | iOS/iPadOS 18.4+, macOS 15.4+. The 18.0–18.3 hybrid-vs-local mismatch is fixed in 18.4. |
| **Google Password Manager** | ✅ | ✅ | On by default; broadest and most reliable. |
| **Windows Hello** | ✅ | ❌ | Device-bound (TPM). Would be a single-device wallet — **`createPasskey()` rejects it before deriving**; the `get()` path applies no gate today ([#13](https://github.com/DeOrganized/stacks-passkey-wallet/issues/13), [`get-vs-create-ambiguity.md`](./get-vs-create-ambiguity.md#checking-backup-eligibility-on-the-get-path)). |
| **Hardware keys** | ✅ (fw ≥5.2) | ❌ | Device-bound. |
| **Hybrid / caBLE (QR)** | ✅ | follows phone's provider | |

## Launch support (this library)

| Tier | Target |
|---|---|
| Supported | iCloud Keychain (iOS/iPadOS 18.4+, macOS 15.4+); Google Password Manager (Chrome/Edge 116+, incl. Windows & Android) |
| Rejected at `createPasskey()` | Windows Hello, hardware keys — device-bound; no `get()`-path gate today (#13) |
| Unsupported | Firefox Android, Android WebView, cross-vendor hybrid |

The **iOS 18.4 floor is a conservative user-agent check in code**
(`assertPlatformSupportsPrf`), not a capability probe — user agents it does not
recognize pass through to WebAuthn's own typed errors. Windows *users* are
supported via Google Password Manager; the host calls `providerGuidance()`
during create to steer them there (see [`integration.md`](./integration.md)).

## Failure surface (for feature detection)

Unsupported PRF is signalled non-uniformly:

| Situation | `getClientExtensionResults()` |
|---|---|
| Browser ignored the extension | `prf` absent → `PrfUnsupportedError("prf-not-processed")` |
| Authenticator can't PRF at create | `{ prf: { enabled: false } }` → `PrfUnsupportedError("prf-not-enabled")` |
| `get()` returned no bytes | `{ prf: {} }` → `PrfUnsupportedError("no-prf-results")` |

Ground truth is a real `get()` returning `prf.results.first` of 32 bytes.

## Implementation gotchas (carried into the library)

- **Salt is hashed by the browser:** `actualSalt = SHA-256("WebAuthn PRF" ‖ 0x00 ‖ inputSalt)`.
- **HKDF the PRF output** before BIP-39 (don't use PRF bytes directly).
- **Dedicated `get()`** for bytes; don't rely on create-time results.
- **UV consistency:** create and get must use identical `userVerification` (CTAP2
  keeps separate UV/non-UV PRFs). Enforced + tested.
- **UV is not biometric-specific:** a knowledge-factor screen lock (PIN/pattern)
  satisfies `userVerification: "required"` — confirmed on GPM/Android with no
  biometric enrolled. Users who cannot or do not enrol a biometric are not excluded
  from a passkey wallet. Evidence in
  [`prf-verification-checklist.md`](./prf-verification-checklist.md).
